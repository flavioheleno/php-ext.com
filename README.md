[php-ext.com](https://php-ext.com) is a PHP Extension Compatibility Monitoring portal.

This project is *heavily* inspired on [this blog post](https://blog.remirepo.net/post/2020/09/21/PHP-extensions-status-with-upcoming-PHP-8.0).

## How it works?

![How It Works Diagram](docs/images/how-it-works.png)

The diagram above describes the under-the-hood work that is done by this project.

To put it in simple terms, it takes for instance the following combination `amqp:dev@8.0.0-buster`.

The combination is composed by:
- Extension: **amqp**
- Channel: **dev**
- PHP Version: **8.0.0**
- OS: Debian (**buster**)

Once a combination is selected to be tested, the first step is to load the Extension Specifications, which provides details such as required OS packages and other dependencies to be installed prior to building the extension.

The next step is to load the OS Specifications, that provides the commands to be used to install dependencies and also the list of base packages that are required to build software (e.g. [build-essential](https://packages.debian.org/buster/build-essential) on Debian).

Once all specs are loaded, the following checks are done:

1. If the extension is available through the distribution channel: some extensions are only available on their repositories and not on [pecl](https://pecl.php.net);
2. If the extension requires or supports ZTS/NTS: some extensions can only be built using ZTS PHP, other only using NTS PHP;
3. If the extension supports the PHP Version: straightforward min/max PHP version check.

If all checks pass, the next step is to setup the build context (in other words, creating the dockerfile that will be used to build and test this combination).

Once the build context is ready it is sent to the Docker API and the image build is started.

At this point, two more verifications are performed:

1. If the extension build process was successful: the extension can't be tested if it can't be built;
2. If the extension's test suite was fully executed and all tests passed: a failing test is a good signal that there's something wrong with the extension.

Although the process is far from perfect, it's still a very decent indicator that an extension is likely to work in a given setup.
